# StockBroker



I tried to keep the syntax basic so it can be 'lifted' into Java land.

-----------------------------------
This is an imaginary system that is called by another system, e.g. it isn't intended to be
used by a human. It is a portfolio updater for a stock broker. A stock broker attempts to sell
shares in stocks to a client and then will submit the shares traded throughout the day to an exchange
keeping the profit that has been accrued throughout the day's trading.

This code is for updating the stock level that a broker currently has in a preset portfolio cache.
It needs to be updated to include a price update feature, but currently it is a mess :-(
You should go through the process of tidying the code so that you can add the [NEW FEATURE].
There is *just one* Approval added, execute by running the program.

-----------------------------------
You are a consultant just placed on this client, his 15 year old son made this system in his bedroom 
during the summer holidays. It works ( but this exercise was a rush job so possibility of bugs remains ) 
just work on fixing code style, structure, naming, and add lack of constructs while you surround it with 
more tests. The database is just pretend, don't worry about that code, just focus on the Updater.

-----------------------------------
Most importantly, have fun!
